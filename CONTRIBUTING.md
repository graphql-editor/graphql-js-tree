# Contributing to GraphQL JS Tree

We welcome contributions to GraphQL Tree of any kind including documentation, themes,
organization, tutorials, blog posts, bug reports, issues, feature requests,
feature implementations, pull requests, answering questions on the forum,
helping to manage issues, etc.

_Changes to the codebase **and** related documentation, e.g. for a new feature, should still use a single pull request._

## Reporting Issues

If you believe you have found a defect in GraphQL Zeus or its documentation, use
the GitHub [issue tracker](https://github.com/graphql-editor/graphql-zeus/issues) to report
the problem to the maintainers. 

## Code Contribution

GraphQL Zeus is still looking for its direction so remember functionality has to:

- repair existing bugs
- introduce new feature requests

**Bug fixes are, of course, always welcome.**
